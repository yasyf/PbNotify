  <h1>PbNotify: The Pebble Notification API</h1>
  <p>PbNotify is a remote Pebble notification API that provides a public-facing bridge between the Internet and local notifications on your Pebble. It is compatible with both Android and iOS. With one simple request, any webapp or server can now send notifications straight to your wrist. One popular use is to be notified when a long-running command on a remote server completes, with information like exit status easily displayed on your watch, but this is only one example of the many uses for PbNotify.</p>
  <p>Why do you need PbNotify? As a developer, our API gives you the only solution available today to send notifications directly to the wrists of all your users. PbNotify can be set up and integrated with your app, site, or service with a single line of code, and we take care of the rest for you. As a user, PbNotify allows you to receive direct notifications from all your favorite web services. Imagine having your wrist buzz when a stock hits a certain price, an order is made on your site, or any other action is performed, anywhere on the web. PbNotify can be integrated into anything that connects to the Internet; the possibilities are endless!</p>
  <p>We offer a fully-functional week-long trial absolutely <b>free</b>! To begin, please pick a username and password below. After your first seven days, you will be charged a nominal monthly fee of $5 (roughly one Starbucks visit a month).</p>
