  <h1>PbNotify: The Pebble Notification API</h1>
  <p>PbNotify is a Remote Pebble Notification API that provides a public-facing bridge between the Internet at large and local notifications on your Pebble.It is accompanied by a free watchface on the Pebble. This service allows any web app or server that can make a single API call to send notifications straight to your wrist. It was created to be notified when long-running commands on a remote server completed, with metadata like exit status easily being displayed on your watch, but this is only one example of the many uses for PbNotify.</p>
